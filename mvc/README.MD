Update (View):
* New fonts were added: Inter and Robobo, for better readability and looks. 
* Resizing of headers was done because of the new fonts.


Upcoming in next steps (View):
* Code format: I want to break it into smaller components and remove repetitive parts as much as possible.
* Naming: The naming will be changed to camel later on.
* Create a global search: will show the results on a new page. A new page would be better, as the admin constantly searching for ticket IDs and WBIs, and thus, one could have multiple tickets that the admin\manager will want to go through.
* After the creation of the controller, variables that will hold the data will be updated and changed.
* Adding pages and results per page after establishing the second point in this list.
* Adding restrictions for everyone except admins and managers (ONLY for their projects).
* Improving the onboarding list: Making it editable.
* If the username or password are wrong then and error message will pop, same regarding not finishing the onboarding checklist, and if the file is too big as an attachment.
