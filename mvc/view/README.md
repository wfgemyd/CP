First Step: Install Dependencies
  1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
  2. Navigate to the root folder of the downloaded Vue.js project, which is named "view".
  3. Once you are inside the root folder, run the command "npm install" (without quotes).
    * This command will install all the necessary dependencies and packages required for the project to run properly.
    * The installation process may take a few minutes, depending on the number and size of the dependencies.
    * Make sure you have a stable internet connection during this step.
     
Second Step: Navigate to the Dist Folder
  1. After the installation is complete, navigate to the "dist" folder within your project.
    * The "dist" folder is where the production-ready, compiled files of the project are located.
    * You can navigate to the "dist" folder using the "cd" command followed by the path to the folder, for example: "cd view/dist" (without quotes).
     
Third Step: Run the Project in Preview Mode
  1. Once you are inside the "dist" folder, run the command "npm run preview" (without quotes) (could need an administrator mode).
    * Administrator mode is required to ensure that the project has the necessary permissions to run properly.
    * To run the command in administrator mode:
      * On Windows: Right-click on your terminal or command prompt icon and select "Run as administrator" before navigating to the "dist" folder and running the command.
      * On macOS or Linux: Prefix the command with "sudo", like this: "sudo npm run preview" (without quotes), and enter your system password when prompted (if needed).
  2. After running the command, the project will start in preview mode.
    * Preview mode allows you to see how your project will look and function in a production environment.
    * The terminal will display the URL where your project is being served, typically something like "http://localhost:5000" (the port number may vary).
  3. Open a web browser and visit the provided URL to see the project in action.
    * You can now interact with your project and test its functionality.
    * Any changes you make to the project files will not be reflected in the preview mode unless you rebuild the project.

     
- If you encounter any issues during these steps, make sure to double-check the commands and file paths, and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the commands (e.g., in administrator mode). -
